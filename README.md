# cpp-gate1228-game

My first attempts at creating a game using C++ & SFML. Most of the work is in the engine-side: audio, Box2D physics, sprites, saving data to xml and much more...

Currently the project does not compile due to the way it's set up - it will only work on my laptop. 
Might fix it later so this actually compiles- there are some interesting parts to the project.
Most of all, there are many ancient newbie mistakes in this project. For now I will maintain it as a reference.
